This repository contains various Machine Learning projects completed during the course, where different techniques such as data preprocessing, predictive analysis, and model selection are applied. The projects included are:

1. **Titanic Predictive Analysis and Data Preprocessing**:

   - This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using data preprocessing techniques and predictive models, such as logistic regression and decision trees.

2. **Diabetes Analysis**:

   - This project analyzes data from diabetes patients to predict the presence of the disease using linear regression, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques.
     [Notebook](./diabetes_analisis/Diabetes_Analisis.ipynb)

3. **Multiple Linear Regression**:

   - This project applies multiple linear regression to the diabetes dataset, exploring the relationships between various features and the target variable.
